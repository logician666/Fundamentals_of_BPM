# Exercise 1.2
Consider the purchasing process at Ford.
1. Who are the actors in this process?
2. Which actors can be considered as customers in this process?
3. What value does the process deliver to its customers?
4. What are the possible outcomes of this process?

# Solution 1.2
1. The actors in the process are:
  a. Internally: the purchasing department, the warehousing department, and the
  accounts payable department.
  b. Externally: the vendors.
  c. The database (in case of the new process).
2. The purchasing department and the vendors.
3. The purchasing department acquire (in case of desirable outputs) the
products they require to ensure the business continue its sales in response to
demand, while the vendors receive payments against those products (and possibly
the shipping service).
4. We here analyse the outcomes for the two process models, the legacy one, and
the new one:
  a. The legacy process model: has the outcome of a failure to delivery by
  vendor, full compliant delivery, delivery with discrepancies, 

Generally, the process outcomes are permutations of final outcomes of delivery
and payment. A difference between the legacy process and the new one occurs for
delivery with discrepancy, as this component of the outcome is eliminated in the
new process, and thus all such permutation outcomes it is a component of. The
permutation outcomes are as follows:
  a. Failure to delivery by vendor.
  b. Delivery with discrepancy and full payment
  c. Delivery with discrepancy and partial payment.
  d. Delivery in full and full payment.
  e. Delivery in full and partial payment.

Note: in case of business bankruptcy, we may also include the possibility of
failure to pay in full to the possible permutations.
