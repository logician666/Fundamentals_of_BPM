# Exercise 1.1
Consider the following process for the admission of international graduate
students at a university. In order to apply for admission, students first fill
in an online form. Online applications are recorded in an information system to
which all staff members involved in the admissions process have access. After a
student has submitted the online form, a PDF document is generated and the
student is requested to download it, sign it, and send it by post together with
the required documents, which include:
  * certified copies of previous degree and academic transcripts,
  * results of English language test,
  * curriculum vitae,
  * two reference letters.
When these documents are received by the admissions office, an officer checks
the completeness of the documents. If any document is missing, an email is sent
to the student. The student has to send the missing documents by post.  

Assuming the application is complete, the admissions office sends the certified
copies of the degrees to an academic recognition agency, which checks the
degrees and gives an assessment of their validity and equivalence in terms of
local education standards. This agency requires that all documents be sent to it
by post, and that all documents be certified copies of the originals. The agency
sends back its assessment to the university by post as well. Assuming the degree
verification is successful, the English language test results are then checked
online by an officer at the admissions office. If the validity of the English
language test results cannot be verified, the application is rejected (such
notifications of rejection are sent by email).

Once all documents of a given student have been validated, the admissions office
forwards these documents by internal mail to the corresponding academic
committee responsible for deciding whether to offer admission or not. The
committee makes its decision based on the academic degrees and transcripts, the
CV, and the reference letters. The committee meets once every three months to
examine all applications that are ready for academic assessment at the time of
the meeting. At the end of the committee meeting, the chair of the committee
notifies the admissions office of the selection outcomes. This notification
includes a list of admitted and rejected candidates. A few days later, the
admissions office notifies the outcome to each candidate via email.
Additionally, successful candidates are sent a confirmation letter by post.

With respect to the above process, consider the following questions:
  1. Who are the actors in this process?
  2. Which actors can be considered as customers in this process?
  3. What value does the process deliver to its customers?
  4. What are the possible outcomes of this process
# Solution 1.1
1. The actors in the process are:
    a. Applicants (specifically candid students),
    b. The information system that manages the applications,
    c. The admissions office (including all officers working in it),
    d. The academic recognition agency,
    e. The academic committee,
    f. The chair of the committee.

    Note: the post office can be considered as both an actor or a means of
    communication (choreography service). But given its insignificance to the
    process activities, we consider it as the latter.
2. Students are the actors who may be considered as customers in this process.
3. The process provide the value of _admission into university_ for _qualified
students_.
4. Any student applying to the university, either:
    a. Gets approved to the university,
    b. Gets rejected from being admitted,
    c. Receives no information back if his email wasn't communicated with the
    batch of documents sent at the beginning of the process to the admissions 
    office.
